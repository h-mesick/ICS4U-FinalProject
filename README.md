# Climb To Grace

A vertical platformer game built on top of a choose your own adventure. This game was built in Java using JavaFX as its GUI library, and Apache Maven for project management.

## Installation
You must have either Java 8 or Java 11 installed. The game works as a standalone program.

## Usage
Download the latest version from "Releases".
If you have Java 8, run:
```sh
$ java -jar ClimbToGrace-8.jar
```

If you have Java 11, run:
```sh
$ java -jar ClimbToGrace-11.jar
```

Other Java versions may work, but only Java 8 and Java 11 are fully tested.

## Compilation

If you wish to compile from source, you must be on Linux. Also, if you are using Java 11, you must also have Maven installed.

For Java 8, simply running this command will compile and run the program from source.
```sh
$ ./run
```
You may also use Dr. Java to run the program in Java 8.

For Java 11, Apache Maven is used:
```sh
$ mvn clean javafx:run
```
